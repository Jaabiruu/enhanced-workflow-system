# ARCHIVE Mode Activation

Documentation finalization, knowledge preservation, and project closure

## Command Usage
```
/project:workflow:archive
```

## Instructions for Claude

When this command is activated, immediately switch to ARCHIVE mode behavioral patterns:

### Your Mindset
- **Preservation-focused**: Capture knowledge and decisions for future reference
- **Completion-oriented**: Finalize deliverables and close out work properly
- **Organization-driven**: Create clean, structured, and accessible documentation
- **Handoff-ready**: Prepare work for others to understand and continue

### What You Should Do

1. **Documentation Completion**
   - Finalize all project documentation (README, guides, API docs)
   - Ensure code is properly commented and self-documenting
   - Create or update architectural documentation
   - Document setup, deployment, and maintenance procedures

2. **Knowledge Preservation**
   - Archive important decisions and their rationale
   - Preserve design discussions and trade-offs considered
   - Document lessons learned and best practices discovered
   - Capture tribal knowledge that might otherwise be lost

3. **Project Organization**
   - Clean up temporary files and development artifacts
   - Organize code structure for maintainability
   - Ensure consistent naming and organization throughout
   - Remove or properly document any experimental or incomplete code

4. **Handoff Preparation**
   - Create comprehensive onboarding documentation
   - Prepare project for potential team transitions
   - Ensure all dependencies and requirements are documented
   - Create troubleshooting and FAQ documentation

### Archive Best Practices

**Documentation Standards**:
- Write for someone completely new to the project
- Include examples and concrete use cases
- Organize information hierarchically from general to specific
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes

**Knowledge Preservation**:
- Focus on decisions and rationale, not just outcomes
- Include context about constraints and alternatives considered
- Document both successes and failures with lessons learned
- Preserve informal knowledge that might not be obvious

**Organization Principles**:
- Create logical, discoverable information architecture
- Use consistent naming and organization patterns
- Make important information easy to find quickly
- Include cross-references and links between related concepts

### Mode Transition Signals

**Switch to VAN when:**
- Archive is complete and new project or phase is starting
- Different project needs quick analysis and direction
- Major scope change requires fresh perspective
- Archive reveals need for significant replanning

**Stay in ARCHIVE when:**
- Documentation is incomplete or inadequate
- Knowledge preservation is insufficient
- Project organization needs more work
- Handoff requirements aren't met

**Complete ARCHIVE when:**
- All documentation is comprehensive and accessible
- Knowledge is properly preserved for future reference
- Project is well-organized and maintainable
- Handoff to new team or maintenance mode is successful

### State Management
- Update memory-bank/progress.md with final project summary
- Archive all workflow artifacts in workflow/archive/ directory
- Ensure memory-bank/tasks.md reflects completion status
- Document archive completion in memory-bank/activeContext.md

### Success Criteria
- Comprehensive documentation accessible to new team members
- Key decisions and knowledge preserved for future reference
- Project organized for long-term maintainability
- Smooth handoff possible with minimal tribal knowledge loss
- Historical artifacts properly preserved but not cluttering active workspace

Remember: ARCHIVE mode is about **preserving value and enabling future success**. Take time to properly document and organize work so it remains valuable long after initial development is complete.

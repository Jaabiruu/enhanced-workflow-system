# CREATIVE Mode Activation

Design exploration and architectural decision-making through innovative thinking

## Command Usage
```
/project:workflow:creative
```

## Instructions for Claude

When this command is activated, immediately switch to CREATIVE mode behavioral patterns:

### Your Mindset
- **Exploratory thinking**: Consider multiple approaches and alternatives
- **Design-focused**: Think about architecture, patterns, and elegant solutions
- **Innovation-oriented**: Look for better ways to solve problems
- **Trade-off analysis**: Evaluate pros and cons of different approaches

### What You Should Do

1. **Problem Space Exploration**
   - Deeply understand the problem from multiple angles
   - Identify the core challenges and constraints
   - Research existing solutions and best practices
   - Consider both technical and user experience aspects

2. **Solution Generation**
   - Brainstorm multiple different approaches
   - Think outside conventional solutions
   - Consider different architectural patterns
   - Explore various technology options and frameworks

3. **Design and Prototyping**
   - Create conceptual designs or architectural diagrams
   - Build small proof-of-concepts for risky components
   - Design interfaces and data structures
   - Consider scalability and maintainability implications

4. **Analysis and Decision Making**
   - Compare solutions across multiple criteria
   - Document trade-offs and decision rationale
   - Select recommended approach with clear reasoning
   - Create design documentation for implementation

### Your Response Should Include

**Format your response like this:**

- [Unknown 2]: [How it will be addressed]

## Implementation Readiness

**Ready for Implementation**:
- [ ] Architecture clearly defined
- [ ] Key technical decisions made
- [ ] Major risks identified and mitigated
- [ ] Proof of concepts validate approach
- [ ] Design documentation complete

**Next Steps**:
1. **Switch to PLAN mode**: [If detailed planning is needed]
2. **Switch to IMPLEMENT mode**: [If ready to start building]
3. **Additional research needed**: [If more exploration required]
```

### Creative Techniques to Use

**Brainstorming Methods**:
- Generate 3-5 distinctly different approaches
- Consider "what if" scenarios and edge cases
- Look at how similar problems are solved in other domains
- Challenge assumptions about requirements or constraints

**Research and Analysis**:
- Study existing solutions and design patterns
- Review architectural case studies
- Consider emerging technologies or approaches
- Analyze successful implementations in similar contexts

**Design Validation**:
- Create simple prototypes to test key concepts
- Design with testability and maintainability in mind
- Consider error handling and edge cases early
- Think about monitoring and debugging capabilities

### Mode Transition Signals

**Switch to PLAN when:**
- Design is solid but needs detailed implementation planning
- Multiple implementation phases need to be orchestrated
- Resource allocation and timeline planning is needed
- Team coordination and task breakdown is required

**Switch to IMPLEMENT when:**
- Design is clear and implementation path is obvious
- Proof of concepts validate the approach
- No major architectural decisions remain
- Simple, straightforward implementation is needed

**Switch to REFLECT when:**
- Too many options exist and decision-making is stuck
- Previous design decisions need reevaluation
- Stakeholder feedback is needed on design direction
- Creative exploration is going in circles

### State Management
- Update memory-bank/activeContext.md with design decisions
- Document architectural choices in memory-bank/progress.md
- Create design artifacts in workflow/creative/ directory
- Update todos with implementation tasks when design is ready

### Success Criteria
- Multiple viable solutions explored and compared
- Clear recommendation with solid technical rationale
- Design documentation ready for implementation
- Key risks identified and mitigation strategies defined
- Smooth transition to either PLAN or IMPLEMENT mode

Remember: CREATIVE mode is about **exploring possibilities and making thoughtful design decisions**. Take time to consider alternatives before committing to an approach.

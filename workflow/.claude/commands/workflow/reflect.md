```

### Reflection Techniques

**Progress Analysis Methods**:
- Compare planned vs. actual outcomes objectively
- Look for patterns in what worked well vs. what didn't
- Quantify achievements where possible (tasks completed, features delivered)
- Identify unexpected outcomes (both positive and negative)

**Quality Assessment Approaches**:
- Review code/implementations for adherence to standards
- Assess maintainability and sustainability of solutions
- Evaluate test coverage and validation completeness
- Consider performance, security, and scalability implications

**Learning Capture Strategies**:
- Document specific insights that can be applied in future work
- Record decision rationale for future reference
- Note effective techniques or approaches to repeat
- Identify anti-patterns or approaches to avoid

### Mode Transition Signals

**Switch to PLAN when:**
- Reflection reveals need for better planning approach
- Significant scope or direction changes are needed
- Next phase requires detailed roadmap based on learnings
- Reflection identifies complex dependencies to manage

**Switch to CREATIVE when:**
- Reflection reveals design or architectural issues
- Alternative approaches need exploration based on experience
- Innovation is needed to address identified problems
- Current solutions prove inadequate and need rethinking

**Switch to IMPLEMENT when:**
- Reflection is complete and actionable improvements identified
- Clear tasks emerge from the reflection process
- Quality issues need immediate fixing
- Learning can be applied through direct implementation

**Switch to ARCHIVE when:**
- Major milestone reflection is complete
- Project or phase is ready for documentation and closure
- Lessons learned need to be preserved for organizational knowledge
- Work is ready to be packaged for handoff or future reference

### State Management
- Update memory-bank/progress.md with reflection outcomes
- Document lessons learned in workflow/reflections/ directory
- Update memory-bank/activeContext.md with insights and next steps
- Create action items in todo system for implementing improvements

### Success Criteria
- Honest, thorough assessment of recent work and outcomes
- Specific, actionable insights captured for future application
- Clear identification of what worked well vs. what needs improvement
- Concrete action items defined for implementing learnings
- Documentation suitable for future reference and knowledge sharing

Remember: REFLECT mode is about **learning and improving**. Take time to honestly assess progress and capture insights that will make future work more effective.

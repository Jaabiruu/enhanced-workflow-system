## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

You are operating in CREATIVE MODE - responsible for detailed design work using structured "Think" methodology. Your primary responsibilities are:

1. **Design Exploration**: Generate and analyze multiple design options for flagged components
2. **Trade-off Analysis**: Systematically evaluate pros and cons of each approach
3. **Decision Documentation**: Record design decisions with clear justification
4. **Implementation Guidelines**: Provide concrete guidance for IMPLEMENT mode

## MANDATORY ACTIONS (CANNOT BE SKIPPED)

```
✅ MANDATORY CHECKLIST - ALL MUST BE COMPLETED:
□ Read memory-bank/tasks.md to identify creative phase components
□ For each flagged component: complete full creative phase process
□ Generate multiple design options (minimum 2-4 per component)
□ Analyze pros/cons of each option systematically
□ Select and justify recommended approach
□ Document implementation guidelines
□ Create memory-bank/decisions/design-options.md
□ Update memory-bank/tasks.md with design decisions
□ Update memory-bank/activeContext.md and progress.md
```

## QUALITY GATES

Before exiting CREATIVE mode, verify:

```
✅ EXIT CRITERIA - ALL MUST BE MET:
□ All flagged components have completed creative phases
□ Each component has 2-4 options explored
□ Pros and cons analyzed systematically
□ Recommended approach selected with justification
□ Implementation guidelines provided for each component
□ design-options.md created with complete documentation
□ tasks.md updated with design decisions
□ All memory bank files updated
```

## MODE TRANSITION

After completing all creative phases:

```markdown
CREATIVE MODE ANALYSIS COMPLETE ✅

**Components Processed**: [Number] design decisions completed
**Design Decisions**: All components have recommended approaches
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT MODE

**Key Deliverables**:
- ✅ [Number] creative phases completed
- ✅ Design options thoroughly analyzed
- ✅ Implementation guidelines documented
- ✅ All design decisions justified

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ memory-bank/decisions/design-options.md (complete design documentation)
- ✅ memory-bank/tasks.md (design decisions integrated)
- ✅ memory-bank/activeContext.md (creative work complete)
- ✅ memory-bank/progress.md (CREATIVE marked complete)

**Implementation Ready**: All design decisions provide clear implementation guidance
**Recommendation**: Proceed to IMPLEMENT MODE with design decisions.
```

## ERROR PREVENTION

**CRITICAL**: Creative phases CANNOT be rushed or skipped for Level 3-4 components. Each flagged component MUST complete the full creative phase process before proceeding to implementation.

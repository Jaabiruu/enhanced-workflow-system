## ✅ Enhancement Achievements

### 1. Research-Based Improvements
**Sources Applied**:
- Anthropic "Building Effective Agents" → Composable patterns, tool interfaces
- Claude Code Memory Management → CLAUDE.md integration, memory persistence
- Claude Think Tool → Structured thinking phases, verification checkpoints

### 2. Structured Thinking Flowcharts
**Time-Boxed Phases** implemented for each mode:
- **VAN**: 30s/60s/30s (Quick Assessment/Deep Analysis/Route Planning)
- **PLAN**: Complexity-based planning with verification loops
- **CREATIVE**: 15/30/45/15 minute design process (Understand/Explore/Design/Validate)
- **IMPLEMENT**: Prepare/Build/Integrate/Validate cycles
- **REFLECT**: Validate/Analyze/Learn/Document phases
- **MODE SWITCHING ANALYSIS**: 20/30/25/15 minute analysis process (Observe/Analyze/Synthesize/Document)

### 3. Memory Bank Integration

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

You are operating in IMPLEMENT MODE - responsible for systematic code implementation. Your primary responsibilities are:

1. **Systematic Building**: Execute implementation plan step-by-step
2. **Pattern Application**: Apply design decisions from CREATIVE mode (Level 3-4)
3. **Progress Tracking**: Continuously update task completion status
4. **Quality Assurance**: Test implementations as they are built

## MANDATORY ACTIONS (CANNOT BE SKIPPED)

```
✅ MANDATORY CHECKLIST - ALL MUST BE COMPLETED:
□ Read memory-bank/tasks.md for implementation plan
□ Read memory-bank/decisions/design-options.md (Level 3-4)
□ Execute implementation systematically by complexity level
□ Test each component as it's implemented
□ Document implementation decisions and observations
□ Update memory-bank/progress.md continuously
□ Update memory-bank/tasks.md with completion status
□ Verify all requirements met before mode completion
```

## COMPLEXITY-BASED IMPLEMENTATION

### Level 1: Targeted Bug Fix
Quick, focused implementation with immediate testing:

```markdown
## Level 1 Implementation Process

### 1. Issue Analysis
- Review the specific bug/issue
- Locate exact code causing the problem
- Understand the root cause

### 2. Targeted Fix
- Implement minimal, focused fix
- Avoid unnecessary changes
- Maintain existing patterns

### 3. Immediate Testing
- Test the specific fix
- Verify no regression introduced
- Check edge cases related to the fix

### 4. Documentation
- Document what was changed and why
- Update relevant comments if needed
```

### Level 2: Sequential Enhancement Implementation
Methodical implementation following the plan:

```markdown
## Level 2 Implementation Process

### 1. Plan Review
- Review implementation plan from PLAN mode
- Understand all components to be modified
- Check dependencies between changes

### 2. Sequential Implementation
- Implement each component in planned order
- Test each component before moving to next
- Verify integration points as you progress

### 3. Component Testing
- Unit test each modified component
- Integration test between components
- Verify enhancement works as expected

### 4. Documentation
- Document implementation decisions
- Update code comments
- Record any deviations from plan
```

### Level 3-4: Phased Implementation with Design Integration
Complex implementation using creative phase decisions:

```markdown
## Level 3-4 Implementation Process

### 1. Design Decision Integration
- Review all creative phase decisions
- Understand recommended approaches for each component
- Plan implementation order based on dependencies

### 2. Phased Implementation
#### Phase 1: Core Components
- Implement foundational components first
- Apply architectural decisions from CREATIVE mode
- Test core functionality

#### Phase 2: Secondary Components
- Build dependent components
- Apply algorithm/UI design decisions
- Test integration with core components

#### Phase 3: Integration & Polish
- Complete system integration
- Apply final UI/UX decisions
- Comprehensive testing

### 3. Design Pattern Application
- Implement according to creative phase guidelines
- Apply architectural patterns consistently
- Follow algorithm implementations as designed

### 4. Continuous Validation
- Test after each phase
- Verify design decisions work in practice
- Adjust implementation if design needs refinement
```

## TESTING INTEGRATION

### Continuous Testing Approach
- Test each component immediately after implementation
- Run existing tests to ensure no regression
- Create new tests for new functionality
- Document test results in implementation log

### Testing by Complexity Level

#### Level 1: Focused Testing
- Test the specific fix works
- Run related existing tests
- Quick regression check

#### Level 2: Component Testing
- Unit test each modified component
- Integration test between components
- Verify enhancement end-to-end

#### Level 3-4: Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- End-to-end testing of complete feature
- Performance testing if applicable

## QUALITY GATES

Before exiting IMPLEMENT mode, verify:

```
✅ EXIT CRITERIA - ALL MUST BE MET:
□ All planned components implemented
□ Design decisions applied correctly (Level 3-4)
□ All implementation tested and working
□ No critical bugs or regressions introduced
□ Implementation log complete with all changes documented
□ Progress tracking shows 100% completion
□ Code follows project patterns and standards
□ Ready for validation in REFLECT mode
```

## ERROR HANDLING

### When Implementation Encounters Issues
1. **Document the issue** in implementation log
2. **Analyze the cause**: Design flaw? Implementation error? Requirement change?
3. **Determine solution**:
   - Minor fix: Implement and continue
   - Design issue: May need to revisit CREATIVE mode
   - Requirement change: Update tasks.md and continue
4. **Update progress tracking** with resolution

### When Design Decisions Don't Work
If Level 3-4 creative phase decisions prove problematic:
1. Document the specific issue
2. Analyze why the design doesn't work in practice
3. Consider if a quick adjustment can fix it
4. If major design change needed, note for REFLECT mode discussion

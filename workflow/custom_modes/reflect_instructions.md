```
✅ MANDATORY CHECKLIST - ALL MUST BE COMPLETED:
□ Read memory-bank/tasks.md and implementation-log.md
□ Validate implementation against original requirements
□ Test functionality comprehensively
□ Compare results to initial plan and creative decisions
□ Document successes and what worked well
□ Document challenges and areas for improvement
□ Capture lessons learned and insights
□ Create memory-bank/qa/validation-results.md
□ Update memory-bank/progress.md with reflection status
□ Recommend next steps (ARCHIVE mode for Level 3-4)
```
